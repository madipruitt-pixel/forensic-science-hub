# Common Drugs & Their Effects 
Understanding common drugs and how they affect the body is an important part of forensic toxicology.   
This topic provides a high-level overview of widely used substances and their potential effects, without instructing anyone on use. 

--- 
## 1. Alcohol 
- **Type:** Depressant   
- **Effects on the body:** Slowed reaction time, impaired judgment, loss of coordination, possible memory lapses   
- **Forensic relevance:** Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) can indicate impairment; often measured in DUI investigations 
--- 
## 2. Caffeine 
- **Type:** Stimulant   
- **Effects on the body:** Increased alertness, elevated heart rate, diuretic effects   
- **Forensic relevance:** Usually safe in normal amounts, but high doses or combinations with other stimulants can affect behavior or health 
--- 
## 3. Nicotine / Tobacco 
- **Type:** Stimulant   
- **Effects on the body:** Increased heart rate and blood pressure, addiction potential   
- **Forensic relevance:** Often detected in hair or blood for exposure history; can impact health-related investigations 
--- 
## 4. Cannabis (Marijuana) 
- **Type:** Psychoactive / depressant effects   
- **Effects on the body:** Altered perception, impaired short-term memory, delayed reaction time   
- **Forensic relevance:** Can be detected in blood, urine, or hair; impacts impairment investigations

## 5. Common Recreational Drugs 

| Drug | Type | Effects | Forensic Relevance | 

|------|------|---------|------------------| 

| Cocaine | Stimulant | Increased energy, euphoria, elevated heart rate | Detection indicates use or exposure; may be linked to overdose | 
| MDMA / Ecstasy | Stimulant / Hallucinogen | Euphoria, heightened sensations, dehydration risk | Often detected in nightlife or overdose cases | 
| Heroin / Opioids | Depressant | Pain relief, drowsiness, risk of respiratory depression | Frequent cause of overdoses; toxicology helps determine cause of death | 
| Methamphetamine | Stimulant | Increased alertness, aggression, cardiovascular risk | Can be detected in blood, urine, hair; associated with behavioral effects |

## Why This Matters in Forensics 
- Detecting substances helps investigators understand **possible impairment or cause of death**   
- Knowing typical effects allows forensic analysts to **correlate observed behavior with toxicology results**   
- Supports evidence from other forensic methods, like bloodstain analysis or eyewitness accounts 
--- 
## Summary 
Forensic toxicology examines both **presence** and **effects** of substances.   
Understanding common drugs and their physiological or behavioral impacts helps investigators interpret evidence, connect actions to substances, and strengthen case conclusions.
