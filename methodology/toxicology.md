# Toxicology / Drug Analysis 
Toxicology is the study of **how chemicals, drugs, and poisons affect the body**.   
In forensic science, toxicology is used to detect substances that may have contributed to illness, injury, or death. 
Drug analysis is a key part of forensic toxicology, helping investigators identify substances in biological samples.

## Why Toxicology Matters in Forensics 
- Determines whether chemicals or drugs were present in the body   
- Helps explain symptoms, behaviors, or cause of death   
- Can link a substance to a crime scene, overdose, or poisoning   
- Supports other forensic evidence such as blood, hair, or tissues   
--- 
## Common Samples Tested 
Forensic toxicologists analyze a variety of biological samples, including: 
- Blood and urine   
- Saliva or sweat   
- Hair and nails   
- Stomach contents or tissues (postmortem cases) 
Each sample type can provide information about **substances used, timing, and exposure levels**.

## How Toxicology Analysis Works (Conceptual Overview) 
1. **Collection and Preservation**   
   - Proper handling and chain of custody are critical   
   - Prevents contamination or degradation of samples 
2. **Screening Tests**   
   - Quick tests to detect the presence of common drugs or chemicals   
   - Examples: immunoassays or colorimetric tests 
3. **Confirmatory Tests**   
   - Detailed, accurate analysis using instruments such as:   
     - Gas Chromatography (GC)   
     - Mass Spectrometry (MS)   
     - High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
4. **Interpretation**   
   - Determines the type, concentration, and possible effects of the substance   
   - Helps answer questions about timing, dosage, or influence on behavior 
> Note: This is a conceptual overview; laboratory procedures require specialized training and equipment.

## Limitations of Toxicology Evidence 
- Levels of substances may change over time or postmortem   
- Some substances are rapidly metabolized and may not be detectable   
- Detection alone does not prove intent or effect on behavior   
- Requires careful interpretation and corroboration with other evidence 
--- 
## Why Toxicology Is Useful 
- Supports investigations into overdoses, poisonings, and impairment cases   
- Provides objective, scientific evidence about substances in the body   
- Strengthens conclusions from other forensic evidence, such as bloodstains or witness reports   
- Can help exonerate individuals falsely accused of substance-related crimes

## Summary 
Forensic toxicology combines biology, chemistry, and analytical science to detect drugs, poisons, and chemicals.   
While powerful, toxicology evidence must be interpreted carefully and in context with other findings to draw reliable conclusions.
