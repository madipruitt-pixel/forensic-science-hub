# DNA Analysis 
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that contains the genetic instructions for all living organisms.   
In forensic science, DNA analysis is used to **identify individuals** and link them to biological evidence found at a scene.

## Why DNA Is Useful in Forensics 
- Every person (except identical twins) has a unique DNA profile   
- DNA can be recovered from small biological samples such as:   
  - Blood, saliva, or semen   
  - Hair with root attached   
  - Skin cells left on objects or surfaces   
- High accuracy makes DNA one of the most reliable forms of evidence

## Steps in DNA Analysis (Conceptual Overview) 
1. **Collection**   
   - Evidence is carefully collected and preserved to prevent contamination   
   - Chain of custody is maintained 
2. **Extraction**   
   - DNA is separated from cells in the sample   
   - Quality and quantity of DNA are evaluated 
3. **Amplification (PCR)**   
   - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to make millions of copies of DNA   
   - Enables analysis even from tiny samples 
4. **Comparison / Profiling**   
   - DNA is compared to a known reference (suspect, victim, or database)   
   - Unique patterns are identified using Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) 
5. **Interpretation and Reporting**   
   - Analysts evaluate whether matches are statistically significant   
   - Findings are documented for legal or investigative use 
> Note: This is a conceptual overview; laboratory procedures require specialized equipment and training.

## Limitations of DNA Evidence 
- Contamination can occur if samples are mishandled   
- Degraded or mixed samples may complicate analysis   
- Statistical interpretation must be done carefully   
- DNA presence does **not** prove guilt — it only indicates contact or presence 
Because of these factors, DNA is usually considered **alongside other evidence** such as fingerprints, trace evidence, or eyewitness accounts.

## Why DNA Analysis Matters 
- Provides highly specific identification of individuals   
- Can link a person to a crime scene, object, or victim   
- Can exonerate individuals falsely accused   
- Supports other forensic findings and strengthens cases 
DNA analysis exemplifies how modern forensic science uses biology and technology to generate objective, reproducible results.
