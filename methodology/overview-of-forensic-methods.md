# Overview of Forensic Methods 
Forensic science uses a variety of **methods and techniques** to collect, analyze, and interpret evidence.   
These methods combine **observation, biology, chemistry, physics, and technology** to help investigators understand what happened during a crime or incident.

## Key Forensic Methods Covered So Far 
1. **Fingerprint Analysis**   
   - Identifies individuals based on unique ridge patterns   
   - Connects suspects to crime scenes or objects 
2. **DNA Analysis**   
   - Uses genetic material to uniquely identify people   
   - Can confirm or exclude involvement 
3. **Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA)**   
   - Studies the size, shape, and distribution of bloodstains   
   - Helps reconstruct events and sequence of actions 
4. **Trace Evidence**   
   - Examines small or microscopic materials like hair, fibers, glass, or soil   
   - Links people, objects, and locations through material transfer 
5. **Toxicology & Drug Analysis**   
   - Detects chemicals, drugs, and poisons in biological samples   
   - Helps determine exposure, impairment, or cause of death 
6. **Drug Effects / Common Substances**   
   - Provides context for interpreting toxicology results   
   - Explains physiological and behavioral impacts

## Common Features of Forensic Methods 
- **Scientific basis:** Methods rely on validated scientific principles   
- **Evidence handling:** Chain of custody and proper collection are critical   
- **Analysis & interpretation:** Evidence is examined carefully, often with multiple experts   
- **Limitations:** Every method has potential errors or constraints, emphasizing corroboration with other evidence

## How Methods Work Together 
- Multiple methods often **overlap** to build a stronger case   
- Example: Bloodstains (BPA) + DNA analysis + toxicology → reconstructs events and identifies participants   
- Example: Fingerprints + trace evidence → links suspect to crime scene and objects   
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration ensures thorough, reliable results

## Summary 
Forensic methods are tools that allow investigators to **observe, measure, and interpret evidence** scientifically.   
Understanding the strengths, limitations, and interconnections of these methods helps learners appreciate the **complexity and rigor** of forensic science. 
This page acts as a bridge to further applications, including quizzes, case studies, and specialized topics.
