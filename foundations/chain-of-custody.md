# Chain of Custody 
Chain of custody refers to the **documented process that tracks the 
collection, handling, transfer, storage, and analysis of evidence** 
from the moment it is discovered until it is presented in court. 
Maintaining a clear chain of custody is essential to ensure that 
evidence remains credible, reliable, and legally admissible.

## What Chain of Custody Documents 
A proper chain of custody record typically includes: 
- What the evidence is 
- Where and when it was collected 
- Who collected it 
- Every person who handled or transferred the evidence 
- When and why each transfer occurred 
- How the evidence was stored 
This documentation creates a continuous record of accountability. 

--- 
## Why Chain of Custody Is Important 
Evidence must be shown to be: 
- Authentic (it is what it claims to be) 
- Unaltered (it has not been tampered with) 
- Properly handled (to prevent contamination or loss) 

If the chain of custody is broken or unclear, the reliability of the 
evidence may be questioned, regardless of its scientific value. 

--- 
## Relationship to Evidence Integrity 
Chain of custody helps protect evidence from: 
- Contamination 
- Loss or damage 
- Accidental mixing with other evidence 
- Intentional tampering 

This is especially important for trace and biological evidence, which 
can be easily altered by improper handling.

## Chain of Custody and Locard’s Exchange Principle 
Locard’s Exchange Principle explains that contact results in evidence 
transfer. Chain of custody ensures that **new, unintended transfers** 
do not occur after evidence is collected. 

Proper documentation and handling help distinguish between: 
- Evidence transferred during the event 
- Evidence transferred during investigation or analysis 
--- 
## Legal Implications 
Because forensic evidence may be used in legal proceedings, courts 
require clear documentation showing that evidence was handled properly. 

If gaps exist in the chain of custody: 
- Evidence may be challenged or excluded 
- Conclusions based on that evidence may be questioned 
- The credibility of the investigation may be weakened 
For this reason, documentation is just as important as scientific analysis. 
--- 
## Summary 
Chain of custody is the process that ensures evidence is properly tracked 
and documented from collection to presentation. 
It protects the integrity of evidence, supports reliable interpretation, 
and helps ensure that forensic findings can be evaluated fairly in legal 
contexts.
