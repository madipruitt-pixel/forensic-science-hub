# Overview of Forensic Subfields 
Forensic science is a broad field made up of multiple specialized subfields.   
Each subfield focuses on a particular type of evidence or method of analysis.   
Understanding these subfields helps learners see how forensic investigations 
combine multiple types of expertise to solve cases. 

--- 
## 1. Forensic Biology 
Focuses on biological materials such as: 
- Blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids   
- Hair and skin cells   
- Plant or animal material   
Applications include DNA analysis, blood typing, and identifying biological trace evidence. 

--- 
## 2. Forensic Chemistry / Toxicology 
Deals with the chemical analysis of substances, including: 
- Drugs and poisons   
- Unknown chemicals found at crime scenes   
- Explosives and fire residues   
Toxicology focuses specifically on detecting chemicals that affect the human body. 
--- 
## 3. Fingerprint Analysis / Pattern Evidence 
Analyzes patterns to identify individuals, including: 
- Fingerprints   
- Footwear impressions   
- Tool marks   
Pattern evidence often supports linking a suspect to a scene or object. 
--- 
## 4. Digital Forensics 
Focuses on electronic evidence, such as: 
- Computers and mobile devices   
- Emails, messages, and social media content   
- Network activity and logs   
Digital forensics is increasingly important in modern investigations.

## 5. Forensic Anthropology 
Specializes in human skeletal remains: 
- Identifies age, sex, ancestry, and stature   
- Determines trauma or cause of death   
- Helps in disaster victim identification   
Anthropology is critical when bodies are decomposed, burned, or otherwise unrecognizable. 
--- 
## 6. Forensic Entomology 
Studies insects found on or near remains to: 
- Estimate time of death   
- Understand postmortem environmental conditions   
Insects can provide unique and reliable information when other evidence is limited. 
--- 
## 7. Questioned Documents / Handwriting Analysis 
Examines documents and writing to verify authenticity: 
- Signatures   
- Altered or forged documents   
- Typewritten or printed materials   
Helps detect fraud, forgeries, or tampering with written records. 
--- 
## Why Understanding Subfields Matters 
- Investigators often collaborate across multiple subfields   
- Knowing which experts to consult strengthens case analysis   
- Helps learners see the **interdisciplinary nature** of forensic science   
- Encourages appreciation of both biological and physical evidence 
--- 
## Summary 
Forensic science is not a single discipline, but a collection of specialized fields, each contributing unique expertise to investigations.   
Understanding these subfields helps learners recognize the complexity of real-world forensic work and the importance of collaboration and specialization.
