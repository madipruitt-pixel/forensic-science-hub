# What Is Forensic Science?
Forensic science is the application of scientific principles
to matters of law and criminal investigation.

It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of
evidence in order to reconstruct events and support legal decisions.

## Key Ideas
- Forensic science supports investigations; it does not solve crimes alone
- Evidence must be collected and interpreted scientifically
- Conclusions are probabilistic, not absolute
---

## How Forensic Science Is Used
Forensic science may be applied at many stages of an investigation, including: 
- Examining a crime scene for physical evidence 
- Analyzing evidence in a laboratory 
- Comparing samples (such as patterns or biological material) 
- Interpreting results and explaining their significance 
- Providing expert testimony in court 
Because forensic science operates within the legal system, accuracy, documentation, and transparency are essential.

## What Forensic Science Is *Not* 
Popular media often portrays forensic science as faster, more certain, 
and more conclusive than it actually is. In reality: 
- Forensic science does **not** automatically identify suspects 
- Results are rarely absolute; they are typically probabilistic 
- Evidence can be limited, degraded, or ambiguous 
- Conclusions depend on proper collection and handling of evidence

## Forensic Science and the Scientific Method 
Forensic science relies on the scientific method, which includes: 
1. Observation of evidence 
2. Formation of hypotheses 
3. Testing through analysis 
4. Interpretation of results 
5. Peer review and verification when possible 
Because forensic findings may influence legal outcomes, methods must be 
repeatable, validated, and clearly documented.

## Why This Concept Matters 
Understanding what forensic science is — and what it is not — helps prevent 
misconceptions and unrealistic expectations. 
A solid foundation in this concept allows learners to: 
- Better evaluate forensic evidence presented in real cases 
- Recognize the importance of proper evidence handling 
- Understand why forensic conclusions are rarely stated with certainty 
- Appreciate the role of science within the justice system 
All other forensic topics build upon this foundational understanding.
